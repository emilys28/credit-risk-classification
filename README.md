Module 20 Challenge 

In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## Overview of the Analysis

The data we are analyzing details of loan circumstances. The categories include loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt to income, number of accounts, derogatory marks, total debt, and loan status. Loan status categorizes each loan into a high-risk loan, declared as a 1 value, or a healthy loan, declared as 0. Our goal was to analyze the loan data and train a model to predict whether which criteria would be a high-risk loan or low risk loan.

## Results
* Machine Learning Model 1:
    * 0 (healthy loan) class:
        * Precision: 100%, the model is 100% accurate in positive predictions for healthy loans. 
        * Recall: 99%, the model is 99% accurate in finding ALL positive instances. A lower recall means that the model may miss some positive instances, leading to false negatives.
        * F1-score: 100%, the model has perfect precision and recall. 
    
    * 1 (high-risk loan) class:
        * Precision: 85%, this model is only 85% accurate in positive predictions for unhealthy loans. A lower precision suggests that the model might also classify some instances as positive that are actually negative.
        * Recall: 91%, the model is 91% accurate in finding ALL positive instances. 
        * F1-score: 88%, the model has a high ability in precision and recall but is not perfect. 
        
    * Overall: 
        * Accuracy: 99%, the model is over 99% accurate in its predictions. 
    
    
    
    Recall, also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positive instances in the data. It measures the model's ability to find all positive instances.


## Summary
 
 The logistic regression model performs well in its predictions, as demonstrated by the high accuracy score. However, there was some difference in the prediction performance between the two classes. While the model was extremely accurate predicting healthy loans, it was less accurate for the high-risk loan class.  
 
 I would recommend the logistic regression model, as it has a high overall accuracy rate. However, I also believe it needs more data on high-risk loans to improve its ability to predict high risk loans. As the current stats indicate that the model may incorrectly label a loan as high risk or miss some high-risk ones.


# Requirements
## Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets (30 points)
To receive all points, you must:
- Read the lending_data.csv data from the Resources folder into a Pandas DataFrame. (5 points)
- Create the labels set (y) from the “loan_status” column, and then create the features (X) DataFrame from the remaining columns. (10 points)
- Split the data into training and testing datasets by using train_test_split. (15 points)

## Create a Logistic Regression Model (30 points)
To receive all points, you must:
- Fit a logistic regression model by using the training data (X_train and y_train). (10 points)
- Save the predictions on the testing data labels by using the testing feature data (X_test) and the fitted model. (5 points)
- Evaluate the model’s performance by doing the following:
    - Generate a confusion matrix. (5 points)
    - Generate a classification report. (5 points)
    - Answer the following question: How well does the logistic regression model predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels? (5 points)

## Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report (20 points)
To receive all points, you must:
- Provide an overview that explains the purpose of this analysis. (5 points)
- Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy, precision, and recall scores of the machine learning model. (5 points)
- Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you don’t recommend the model, justify your reasoning. (10 points)

## Coding Conventions and Formatting (10 points)
To receive all points, you must:
- Place imports at the top of the file, just after any module comments and docstrings and before module globals and constants. (3 points)
- Name functions and variables with lowercase characters, with words separated by underscores. (2 points)
- Follow DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principles, creating maintainable and reusable code. (3 points)
- Use concise logic and creative engineering where possible. (2 points)

## Code Comments (10 points)
To receive all points, your code must:
- Be well commented with concise, relevant notes that other developers can understand. (10 points)
