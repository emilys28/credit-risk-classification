## Overview of the Analysis

The data we are analyzing details of loan circumstances. The categories include loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt to income, number of accounts, derogatory marks, total debt, and loan status. Loan status categorizes each loan into a high risk loan, declared as a 1 value, or a healthy loan, declared as 0. Our goal was to analyze the loan data and train a model to predict whether which creiteria would be a high risk loan or low risk loan.

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the accuracy, precision, and recall scores of the machine learning model.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
    * 0 (healthy loan) class:
        * Precision: 100%, 
        * Recall: 99%, 
        * F1-score: 100%, 
    
    * 1 (high-risk loan) class:
        * Precision: 85%, 
        * Recall: 91%, 
        * F1-score: 88%, 
        
    * Overall: 
        * Accuracy: 99%
    
    


## Summary
 
 The logistic regression model performs well in its predictions, as demonstrated by the high accuracy score. However there was some difference in the prediction performance between the two classes. While the model ...
 
 I would recommend the logistic regression model, as it has a high overall accuracy rate. However, I also believe it needs more data on high risk loans to improve its ability to predict high risk loans. As the current stats indicate that the model ...
 
 which may result incorecctly identifying a loan as high risk or missing some high risk ones.
