## Overview of the Analysis

    Provide an overview that explains the purpose of this analysis. (5 points)
The data we are analyzing is 

Our goal was to analyze the loan data and train a model to predict whether which creiteria would be a high risk loan or low risk loan.


    
In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* Explain the purpose of the analysis.
* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any other algorithms).

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the accuracy, precision, and recall scores of the machine learning model.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
    * 0 (healthy loan) class:
        * Precision: 100%
        * Recall: 99%
        * F1-score: 100%
    
    * 1 (high-risk loan) class:
        * Precision: 85%
        * Recall: 91%
        * F1-score: 88%
        
    * Overall: 
        * Accuracy: 99%
    
    


## Summary
Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you donâ€™t recommend the model, justify your reasoning. (10 points)
 
 
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:

* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
